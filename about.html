    <p>In January 2018, Theo Walcott transfered to Everton for over £20 million. That's roughly one and three seventeenths of a Ronaldo, you know the good one, that liked hamburgers and supermodels and didn't need to rip his shirt off everytime he toe-poked a goal home because he wasn't insecure.
      <br>
      <br>Football - it has to be said - has become slightly absurd, very much outrageous and has more than a whiff of downright obscenity. How can one human being garner a value of nearly £200 million pounds whilst we still can't seem to cure cancer, or hangovers, or the Glaswegian accent.
      <br>
      <br>Yes, Neymar, football's equivalent of a mating peacock, is worth twelve and a bit real Ronaldos. Twelve and a bit real Ronaldos! Sorry, but how is Neymar worth twelve and a bit Ronaldos! I mean maybe three and seven ninths of a Neymar might buy you a Ronaldo. However, twelve and a bit real Ronaldos! Nah.
      <br>
      <br>Not that I'm here to knock Neymar, I mean he is an excellent footballer - albeit a repulsive human being, but hey ho, in the twenty-first century we can't have everything. I'm not knocking a Portugese sex-God, a Catalonian smurf, or Gigi Buffon, whose been around long enough to make it into this particular hall of fame.
      <br>
      <br>What we're here for is to hear your stories about the real heroes of football, I'm pretty sure that the Palace fan that got kung-fu kicked by Cantona forgave him, because, well... It's Cantona, a flawed genius with a mad temper.
      <br>
      <br>We want to talk about Pirlo's beard, Jurgen Klopp's 100-yard stare, Rino Gattusso's clear love of unicorns, how Nesta and Cannavaro need a genetically modified love-child and can you find Edgar David's goggles on eBay?
